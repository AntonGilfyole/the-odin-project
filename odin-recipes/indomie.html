        <h3>How to make Indomie Goreng</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 400mL of tap water to a saucepan, and bring to the boil on a stove.</li>
            <li>While you wait for the water to boil, add all the seasoning packets onto a plate, and mix.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil on the small frying pan, and crack an egg into it when it is hot enough.</li>
            <li>As soon as the water is boiled, add the noodle block in, and press it down with a fork so it becomes submerged in the water.</li>
            <li>Check the underside of the egg, and flip it when you think it is ready. (unless you like it sunny side up)</li>
            <li>Un-fold the noodle block with a fork and stir it a little. (It is essentially a long rectangular block that’s folded, so you want to unfold it to its full length)</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles for a total time of 3 minutes, or till your desired chewiness</li>
            <li>Pour the hot water and noodles into a collander in the sink and shake around a bit to drain excess water.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off for the frying pan, move the frying pan to a separate stove.</li>
            <li>Pour the noodles into the plate and mix it around till the sauce is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Chuck the egg on top and you’re done</li>
        </ol>
